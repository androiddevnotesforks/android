# Limitations and Feature Roadmap

### Feature Roadmap
* To directly open the most related app, for eg: Having a share button next to the generated tweet.
* Utilizing the assistant to perform tasks such as scheduling a timer, adding an event to calendar etc.
* Integrate Midjourney and Dall.e 2 model.
* Integrate upscale image AI model.
* Integrate Face restore model
* Integrate AI Interior Model
* Introduce token based pricing system
* Introduce GPT-4 special edition subscription

### Limitations
* The message length of trial users are currently limited. You can write "continue" if your message ends abruptly.
* Your conversation is deleted as soon as you close the app. This means that you can't access the same conversation on different devices right now though the conversations are stored locally on your device.
* Sometimes, when you send a message for the first few times, there might be a noticeable delay. But don't worry, we're working on fixing it.
* The Android code that we use is free for anyone to view and use it for educational purpose, but our servers are not open to the public. We don't have any plans to make our servers available for viewing anytime soon because we want to prevent people from creating identical copies of our app and putting them on the Google Play Store.
* The main code of our server that connects our app to Open AI's server is available for anyone to access.
* The Handy Widget is still in development.

## We have plans to get rid of storing the conversation on our server and move all the process on the device itself. Please let us know your opinions regarding this topic.
