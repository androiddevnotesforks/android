* **How much does OpenAI cost?**

The ChatGPT API is very affordable. A normal chat conversation of about 1000 characters would only cost about $0.001, which is less than a cent. You can have thousands of chats and it would only cost you around $1. Checkout the official pricing [here](https://openai.com/pricing#language-models).

* **Why do we charge for subscription despite if I pay directly to OpenAI?**

The subscription is for the available presets in the library that are available in the app. Additional features include a Handy Widget (Coming soon), Customize assistant's reply etc. All the conversations are processed on our servers and only kept in memory until the app is open. (Check the below question for additional information)


___
* **Is my conversation with GPT safe?**

We only store the conversation while the app is open. The conversation is temporarily kept in the server's memory so that we can send it to OpenAI and maintain a conversation flow between you and GPT. In future, it may be possible for a user to opt in to store the conversation safely in ordet to sync it with their other devices.


___
* **Where is the API Key stored?**

The API Key is saved on your device, so if you uninstall the app and reinstall it, you will need to add the API Key again.

___
* **Is it possible to synchronize my conversation to another device?**

Unfortunately, it is not currently possible to do so. However, we have plans to add this feature in the future. You can check our feature roadmap for updates.
